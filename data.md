### Data format

A data frame with columns:

|variable             |class   |description                                                                                                                                    |
|:--------------------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id                   |integer |An id for each LED light measured                                                                                                              |
|hours                |numeric |The number of hours since the first measurement                                                                                                |
|intensity            |numeric |The lumen output of the bulb. 800 lumens maps to a 60 watt incandescent bulb (https://www.lumens.com/how-tos-and-advice/light-bulb-facts.html) |
|normalized_intensity |numeric |The normalized light output based on the first measured intensity of the bulb                                                                  |
|percent_intensity    |numeric |The normalized_intensity multiplied by 100                                                                                                     |
