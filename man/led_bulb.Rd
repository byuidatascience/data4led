\title{Select a random sample of bulbs all time points.}
\usage{
led_bulb(
  number_bulbs = 1,

    "percent_intensity")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{number_bulbs}{The number of bulbs to sample. Defaults to 1. The most changed argument to the function.}

\item{seed}{is used to make the random sample reproducible.  May change at teacher request.}

\item{dat}{is the data object from which the sample is taken.  Defaults to led_study.}

\item{columns_keep}{are the columns that should be returned from dat. Defaults to keep all the columns.}
